# Markov Models in R

These are the materials for the session on creating Markov Models in R.

In this session we will provide an introduction to a simple Markov model and build this in R. 
The sessions next week will use this model as an example when building an RShiny application.
The underlying model we will use was developed by the DARTH team who have several courses and resources about health economic modelling in R.
Relevant papers are listed below:

- Jalal H, et al. An Overview of R in Health Decision Sciences. Med. Decis. Making. 2017; 37(3): 735-746. 
- Krijkamp EM, et al. Microsimulation modeling for health decision sciences using R: a tutorial. Med. Decis. Making. 2018

The subfolders contain the following contents:

/exercises: three tasks that we will work on during the session.

/solutions: worked out solutions for the three exercises.

/scripts: contains a tidy version of the three-state PSM and some additional code for simulating IPD survival data, plotting survival curves, and teaching notes.

/data: data sets that we use for the PSM model and for the exercises.

psm.Rmd: contains the source code for the PSM-part of the course book.
