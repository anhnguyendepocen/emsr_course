# Markov Models in R

These are the materials for the session on creating Markov Models in R.

In this session we will provide an introduction to a simple Markov model and build this in R. 
The sessions next week will use this model as an example when building an RShiny application.
The underlying model we will use was developed by the DARTH team who have several courses and resources about health economic modelling in R.
