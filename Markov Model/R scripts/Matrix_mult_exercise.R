#Matrix mulitplication exercise

#1. Create a matrix with 5 health states populated with random numbers (use example)


#2. Create a second matrix with 5 columns and 5 rows. All values are 0, other than the first
#    ([1,1]) value which is 1.


#3. Use matrix multiplication to multiply the first matrix by the first row in the 
#   second matrix. Populate the second row in the second matrix with these values


#4. Use the for loop function to repeat this process until the matrix is fully populated
