# PSM

These are the materials for the session on partioned survival modeling (PSM) in R. 

The subfolders contain the following contents:

* `/exercises`: three tasks that we will work on during the session. 

* `/solutions`: worked out solutions for the three exercises.

* `/scripts`: contains a tidy version of the three-state PSM and some additional code for simulating IPD survival data, plotting survival curves, and teaching notes.

* `/data`: data sets that we use for the PSM model and for the exercises.

* `prm.Rmd`: contains the source code for the PSM-part of the course book.
