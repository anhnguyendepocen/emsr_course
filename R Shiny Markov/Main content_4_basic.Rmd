## Introduction

In this session we will combinne the markov model developed in session two and the R shiny knowledge gained in session 3 to develop and R Shiny
app for the markov model.

### Objectives

- Create an R shiny app for a markov model

- Enable a user to enter treatment cost, number of PSA runs and initial age

- Create outputs; a results table and cost-effectivness plane

### Exercises

### Exercise 1: Create a more complex model

In this exercise you'll create a model with more inputs and integrate a function to generate the output: 

1) Create a new Shiny app with the title "Sick Sicker Model in Shiny" and a sidebar Layout

2) In the sidebar panel add four inputs:  

    a) numeric input for treatment cost, with initial value of 200 and a range of 0 - 400
    
    b) numeric input for number of PSA simulations, with initial value of 1000 and a range of 0 - 2000 
    
    c) slider input, y, with a initial value of 25 and a range on 10 - 80 
    
    d) run model action button
    
3) In the main panel, add

    a) a results table, with title
    
    b) a cost-effectiveness plane, with title
    
4) In the server function:

    a) run the model with the user inputs for treatment cost and initial age and for the number of simulations specified by the user
    
    b) Create a table with costs, QALYs, incremental costs and QALYs and ICER (output 3a)
    
    c) Create a cost-effectiveness plane (output 3b)
