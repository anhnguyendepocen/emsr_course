#### Aims

This site contains all material for the EMSR online course. It aims to give an introduction in to health economic modelling and the application of web based user interfaces (R-Shiny) to Health Economics and Decision Science. The aim is that delegates will leave with the ability to create web-based user-interfaces for bespoke health economic models constructed in R.

#### Content

The course is split into four sessions (see below). This repository contains a folder for each of the sessions, in which you can find the exercises, solutions, and any other teaching materials that we use during the course.

<b>1. Partition survival models (PSM)</b>

<b>2. Markov models</b>

<b>3. Introduction to R Shiny</b>

<b>4. Using shiny with health economic models</b>

  - This part is based on the peer-reviewed paper published [here](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/5-69). It goes on to expand the example given in the paper in several respects, including custom UI design with HTML and css, beautiful visualisations using ggplot, downloading plots & tables from the app, etc.

#### Prerequisits

We recommend that those attending the course have undertaken some training in R and health economic evaluation (including state transition and partition survival models) prior to the course. In particular, we assume prior knowledge of custom functions, lists, sourcing R files, loading packages, loops & matrix multiplication (%*%).
